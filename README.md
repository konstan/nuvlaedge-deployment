This repository container the definitions for the installation of the NuvlaBox Engine.

For further details, go to the [online documentation](https://docs.nuvla.io/docs/dave/nuvlabox.html).

## Artifacts

In this repository you will find three different compose files:
 - **docker-compose.yml**: this is meant for a production NuvlaBox Engine installation, 
 where `nuvla.io` is the default Nuvla endpoint
 
 - **docker-compose.localhost.yml**: this is meant for testing purposes, where Nuvla is 
 running on the same machine that will install the NuvlaBox Engine
 
## Deploying

### Prerequisites 

To install the NuvlaBox Engine, you'll need:
 - *Docker (version 18 or higher)*
 - *Docker Compose (version 1.23.2 or higher)*
 
The NuvlaBox Engine will, during bootstrap, double check for other requirements (like 
Docker Swarm), but you'll be automatically prompted in case some of these are not met.


### Production Deployment

_**artifact:** docker-compose.yml_

In this scenario, we assume you are using Nuvla at https://nuvla.io.

 1. login into https://nuvla.io or your Nuvla installation
 2. create a `nuvlabox` resource and save the UUID
 3. simply `export NUVLABOX_UUID=` UUID you saved, **or** paste that UUID in the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the NUVLABOX_UUID environment variable
 4. If you are using your own Nuvla installation also `export NUVLA_ENDPOINT=` IP of the local Nuvla instance, **or** paste that IP in the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the NUVLA_ENDPOINT environment variable 
 5. install the NuvlaBox Engine
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit
    ```

### Test Deployment

_**artifact:** docker-compose.localhost.yml_

In this scenario, we assume you already have a Nuvla deployment running on your machine.

 1. double check your local Nuvla deployment is up and running
    ```bash
    $ docker stack ls
    
    NAME                SERVICES            ORCHESTRATOR
    nuvla               7                   Swarm
    ```
    ```bash
    $ docker stack ps nuvla -f 'desired-state=running'
    
    ID                  NAME                            IMAGE                                                 NODE                    DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE            ERROR               PORTS

    ```
    
 2. because the NuvlaBox containers will need to reach out to the Nuvla containers, they all need 
 to be in the same network, so let's create a dedicated one, and attach `nuvla_proxy` to it
 
    ```bash
    $ docker network create localhost_nuvlabox --attachable
    ```
    ```bash
    $ CONTAINER_ID=`docker inspect $(docker service ps nuvla_proxy --format '{{json .}}' | jq -r .ID) | jq -r .[].Status.ContainerStatus.ContainerID`

    $ docker network connect --alias local-nuvla-endpoint localhost_nuvlabox $CONTAINER_ID
    ```
    
 3. login into your localhost Nuvla, as instructed in https://github.com/nuvla/deployment/tree/master/demo
 4. create a `nuvlabox-record` and save the UUID
 5. simply `export NUVLABOX_UUID=` UUID you saved, **or** paste that UUID in the `docker-compose.localhost.yml` file, under the NUVLABOX_UUID environment variable
 6. install the NuvlaBox Engine
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.localhost.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
    ```
